# dRIConv
This is the github code for the paper "Manufacturing process classification based on distance rotationally invariant convolutions"
The environment for this code is old and as a result it is tough to generate. 
For convenience, you can directly utilize "env.yml" through the following code "conda env create -f env.yml" to generate the virtual environment.

The code for generating 3D files can be found in the following repository "https://github.com/ZhichaoWang970201/HKS-CNN".
You need to sample uniformly on the surface of the 3D model and utilize the sampled point clouds for classification.

I have created 3D models and sampling 1024 points in each model. 
They are saved in the following position onedrive path and you should put them into "dRIConv/data/modelnet40_ply_hdf5_2048".
